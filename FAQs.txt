What is ONNX ?

ONNX is an intermediary machine learning framework used to convert between different machine learning frameworks. So let's say you're in TensorFlow, 
and you want to get to TensorRT, or you're in PyTorch, and you want to get to TFLite, or some other machine learning framework. ONNX is a really good 
intermediary to use to convert your model as you're going through these different machine learning frameworks.

So ONNX has worked really hard to basically implement all kinds of different neural network functions and different functionalities in these machine 
learning models, so I can support  this cross functionality to have baseline, common framework to convert into.

What are the 5 outputs for anchor box ?
Ans. x: x coordinate of the centroid of the anchor box
     y: y coordinate of the centroid of the anchor box
     h: height of the anchor box
     w: width of the anchor box
     Ci/objectness: Confidence score of whether there is an object or not.
